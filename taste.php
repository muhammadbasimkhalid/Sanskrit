				<h1 class="inner_head">Six taste</h1>
				<p>A healthy diet is very important for a healthy body and a healthy mind. An ideal diet, according to āyurvedaḥ incorporates the six tastes prescribed in the literature and comprises a wide variety of fresh fruits, grains and milk<br><br>
					“Taste’ is ‘rasa’ in Sanskrit. It gives different sensations to different parts of the tongue and the palate or the roof of the mouth. Each taste is due to predominance of two of the five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space). Each taste has an effect on the body as well as the mind. The basic principle of diet in āyurvedaḥ is that physical changes as well as mental effects can be observed after consumption of different food types. In this way, food can directly and indirectly affect the three doṣāḥ (vāta, pitta, kapha) of an individual. doṣaḥ means nature or predominance. vāta is the predominance of air, pitta of fire and kapha of water. One can achieve a balance in these three doṣāḥ by regulating one’s diet.
