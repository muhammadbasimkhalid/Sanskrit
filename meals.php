             <p class="font_lg">Before starting a meal say a prayer out of gratitude to the producers of the food. While eating full attention should be given to the food and not to chatting and watching television, operating mobile phones etc..., because this hinders proper digestion. If you are doing these things, you are not aware that you may eat harmful or bad food, you can’t chew properly, the finest and subtlest part of the food cannot convert to a higher mental state, the wrong emotions may get mixed in with the food etc.</p>

        	  <p class="font_lg"><strong>The food should be freshly prepared and consumed within a few hours. Homemade food is much healthier than readymade food, because we have complete control over what we make ourselves like the ingredients, proportions, our emotional state etc. but none over what we buy readymade. Locally produced ingredients are more appropriate for one’s health, because the local weather has a big impact on one’s constitution. Avoid “white poisons” like polished rice, refined sugar, refined salt and white flour but use brown rice, unrefined sugar, unrefined salt and brown flour.

           	 	A healthy dinner may include pulses, soups, raw and, or cooked vegetables, nuts, rice, bread, fruit, some heated milk, pasta etc. Some warm food is recommended in the evening especially as the temperature outside drops. The same recommendations apply as for lunch, but the quantity should be less in the evening and eaten early enough to allow the food to digest before going to sleep. It is very harmful to sleep on a full stomach.
